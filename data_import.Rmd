## Read in some data

Read in the litters dataset.

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df) #can use library(janitor), but at this time, we only need one function (clean_names) which from the janitor package, so we can use janitor::clean_names to import the certain function
```

## Take a look at the data
